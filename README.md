The project *Automated Bird Species Identification through Machine Learning Analysis of Bird Song* aims to accurately classify bird species by analyzing their vocalizations using machine learning techniques. ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) provides a basic neural architecture, while CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) excels in capturing spatial features from sound spectrograms. CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks) combines CNN's feature extraction with RNN's sequential data processing, making it ideal for identifying temporal patterns in bird songs.
